Tasks:  
1. For each sample overview for chapter {chapter}, for the {sample_name} sample, read each of the files across programming languages
2. Make note of the 'steps' that are in each file
3. Determine what the correct "steps" should be for that sample overview, and create a new file with the correct steps
4. Name the file 'prompt--info-chapter-{chapter}-{sample_name}-sample-overview-steps.md'
5. The format for the file is:

```
STEP: ...
STEP: ...
STEP: ...
...
```

Note: Some chapters build on each other, so, the steps should be logical and consistent, as much as possible.  
- Chapter 5 depends on 4 depends on 3  
- Chapter 10 depends on 9 depends on 8 depends on 7  
- Chapter 19 depends on 18  
- Chapter 24 depends on 22
- Chapter 23 depends on 22

Some chapters are more similar than others, so, the steps should be consistent across samples, as much as possible.
- Chapter 18 is roughly similar to 7
- Chapter 7 is roughly similar to 3
- Chapter 22 is roughly similar to 21

Here are the files for all the chapters: {@-}
