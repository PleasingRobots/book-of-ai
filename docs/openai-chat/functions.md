# OpenAI Chat with Function Calling

??? question "Why use OpenAI Function Calling?"

    OpenAI Chat with Function Calling allows you to extend the capabilities of the Language Model (LLM) by adding custom functions that can be called from within the chat session. This enables you to perform a wide range of tasks, such as accessing the current date/time, performing mathematical calculations, reading/writing files, and more.

    By using custom functions, you can enhance the LLM's world knowledge and allow it to 'do stuff' that it wouldn't otherwise be able to do. This can be particularly useful when you need to interact with external systems or perform complex operations that are not natively supported by the LLM.
