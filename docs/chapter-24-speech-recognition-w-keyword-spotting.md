# Speech Recognition with Keyword Spotting

=== "Overview"

    The `ai speech recognize` `--keyword` option allows you to recognize speech with keyword spotting. You can recognize speech from a microphone or a file, and output the recognized text.

    ### Recognize Speech with Keyword Spotting

    ```bash title="Interactive recognition with keyword spotting"
    ai speech recognize --interactive --keyword keyword.table
    ```

    ```bash title="Recognize speech from an audio file with keyword spotting"
    ai speech recognize --file hello-world.wav --keyword keyword.table
    ```

    ??? tip "If you don't have a custom keyword file..."

        [Custom Keyword Portal](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/customkeyword)  
        Create your custom keyword `.table` file.
