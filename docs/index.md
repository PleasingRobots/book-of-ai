    ## Azure AI CLI (`ai`)

    The Azure `ai` Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool to connect and immediately use Azure AI services with or without writing code. The CLI allows the execution of commands through a terminal using interactive command-line prompts or via script.

    You can easily use the `ai` CLI to experiment with key Azure AI service features and see how they work with your use cases. Within minutes, you can setup the required Azure resources, and build a customized Copilot using OpenAI's chat completions APIs and your own data. You can try it out interactively, or script larger processes to automate your own workflows as part of your CI/CD system.

    Additionally you can use the `ai` CLI to dynamically create code to integrate with your own applications in the programming language of your choice (C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript).
