Here's a list of files/chapters for documentation for the `ai` CLI:

```
chapter-3-openai-chat-completions-basics.md
chapter-4-openai-chat-completions-w-function-calling.md
chapter-5-openai-chat-completions-w-rag--ai-search.md
chapter-7-openai-assistants-basics.md
chapter-8-openai-assistants-w-code-interpreter.md
chapter-9-openai-assistants-w-function-calling.md
chapter-10-openai-assistants-w-file-search.md
chapter-12-github-model-chat-completion-basics.md
chapter-13-github-model-chat-completions-w-function-calling.md
chapter-15-ai-studio-chat-completions-basics.md
chapter-16-ai-studio-chat-completions-w-function-calling.md
chapter-18-onnx-chat-completions.md
chapter-19-onnx-chat-completions-w-function-calling.md
chapter-21-speech-synthesis.md
chapter-22-speech-recognition.md
chapter-23-speech-translation.md
chapter-24-speech-recognition-w-keyword-spotting.md
```

I've updated the format for these chapters:

```
chapter-3-openai-chat-completions-basics.md
chapter-4-openai-chat-completions-w-function-calling.md
```

Please read those chapters paying attention to the format, not the specific content.

Now, please read the chapter {chapter} file, and compare the format/style. 

You should see that there are differences in format/style between chapter {chapter} and chapter 3, 4.

Here are a set of instructions that should capture the key aspects of what needs to be done to chapter {chapter}. 

"""
To ensure consistency across all documentation chapters, please follow these instructions:

## Front Matter
- Ensure the front matter includes the `hide: toc` directive.
  ```markdown
  ---
  hide:
  - toc
  ---
  ```

## Introductory Comments
- Add a brief introductory comment before the prerequisites include in both "Overview" and "Sample Code" sections.
  ```markdown
  === "Tutorial"
  
  <insert brief introductory comment>
  
  --8<-- "docs/tip-openai-prereqs.md"
  ```

## Content Organization
- Use collapsible sections (e.g., `??? example`) for detailed explanations and code overviews.
  ```markdown
  ??? example "See the code; learn how it works..."
  ```

## Sample Code Intro
- Add a brief sentence at the top of the "Sample Code" tab prior to the prerequisites include.
  ```markdown
  === "Generate Code"
  
  The `ai dev new` command allows you to generate sample code that demonstrates how to use <specific feature>.
  
  --8<-- "docs/tip-openai-prereqs.md"
  ```

## Filter Commands
- Break the "Filter the list by name" bash code block into two sections: one for listing only language-specific samples and another for filtering the list by name.
  ```bash title="List only C# samples"
  ai dev new list --csharp
  ```

  ```bash title="Filter the list by name"
  ai dev new list <specific sample> --csharp
  ```

## Admonition Placement
- Ensure the `??? example "See the code; learn how it works..."` admonition is placed after the `cd DIR` code block and before the dependencies/run the sample code blocks.
"""

Now, go ahead and make those changes to the chapter {chapter} file and save it to disk with the functions provided.
